			<h2>How Can I Make Sites With Photoshop?</h2>
			<p>Photoshop isn't used to generate the actual code for sites, but, however, it is very useful for designing what your site will look like beforehand. With photoshop, you can make static webpages to illustrate what you will eventually create through code. This is useful because it lets you more quickly code the site while not having to rely solely on memory.
