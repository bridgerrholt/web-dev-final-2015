			<h2>What are IP Addresses?</h2>
			<p>IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are 4-byte numbers assigned to every machine connected to the internet. The layout for IP addresses is like xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, each set of values is a number from 0 to 255. IP addresses can be either static or dynamic. Static IP addresses are good for servers because they never change, which dynamic IP addresses are good for client computers because they can change.</p>
