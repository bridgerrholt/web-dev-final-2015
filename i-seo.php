			<h2>What is SEO?</h2>
			<p>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a method that the big search engines (Google, Bing, Yahoo!, etc.) use to decide which websites should be shown first when somebody searches something. The method of SEO is generally to send out bots (programs that crawl in the internet) to validate websites. Validation is done by checking how well the HTML source code is written and if it complies with W3C standards or not.</p>
