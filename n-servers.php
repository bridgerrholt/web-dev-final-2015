			<h2>What Are Servers?</h2>
			<p>Servers are computers that host and distribute the pages of websites to client computers. So, a client computer (like your phone or desktop) calls for a certain IP address to send a certain file, that IP address is owned by a server, and that server will then send that certain file.</p>
